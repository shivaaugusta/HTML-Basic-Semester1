# 🌐 Web Development Foundation (Semester 1 Project)

### 📝 Background
This was my very first academic project for the **Web Programming Mid-term Exam (UTS)** during my first semester at **UDINUS**. It marks the beginning of my journey into the world of Computer Science and problem-solving through code.

### 🎯 Objective
The goal was to build a structured and semantic web interface from scratch using HTML. It taught me the importance of:
- **Attention to detail** in writing clean code.
- **Structural thinking**, which later became the foundation of my work in data pipeline architecture.
- **Visual communication**, ensuring that data and information are accessible to users.
